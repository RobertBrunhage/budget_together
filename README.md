# budget_together

A project to easily invite and keep track of expenses for a family. This is for now just a fun side project that me and my girlfriend use to keep track of expenses.

## Getting Started

Yeah I should really write this sometime in the future

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/localization` directory, with the help of the Flutter Intl package.
